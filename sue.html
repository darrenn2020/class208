  <h3> It's Guiness World Records fault that we had to make a fake copy. It costs more than $1200 to verify an existing record, and even more money to verify a new one. Even if you fail to break the record, you still have to pay them. What’s even worse, world record holders don’t get any money. We don't have any money, so we had to make a certificate. Also, Austin still would've got the record if he had someone from the company verify the record.</h3><br />
